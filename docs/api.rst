Productions, Grammars and Derivations
-------------------------------------

.. currentmodule:: liblet.grammar

The basic building block of a *grammar* is a *production* represented by the following class.

.. autoclass:: Production

   A convenience method is provided to obtain productions from a suitable string
   representation of them.
   
   .. automethod:: from_string
   
   In order to find productions satisfying a set of properties, a convenience method 
   to build a predicate from a set of keyword arguments is provided.  

   .. automethod:: such_that

A grammar can be represented by the following class, that can be instantiated
given the usual formal definition of a grammar as a tuple.

.. autoclass:: Grammar

   Even in the case of grammars, a convenience method is provided to build a
   grammar from a suitable string representation. Once the productions are obtained
   with :func:`Production.from_string`, the remaining parameters are
   conventionally inferred as detailed below.
   
   .. automethod:: from_string
   
   An utility method is provided to enumerate alternatives for a given *lefthand* side:
   
   .. automethod:: alternatives

Once a grammar has been defined, one can build derivations with the help of the
following class.

.. autoclass:: Derivation

   .. automethod:: step
   
   .. automethod:: leftmost

   .. automethod:: rightmost

   .. automethod:: possible_steps

   .. automethod:: steps

   .. automethod:: sentential_form

Derivations can be displayed using a :obj:`~liblet.display.ProductionGraph`.

Transitions and Automata
------------------------

.. currentmodule:: liblet.automaton

Albeit in the context of parsing (that is the main focus of this library), the
role of *finite state automata* and *regular grammars* is not the main focus, a
couple of classes to handle them is provided.

First of all, a basic implementation of a *transition* is provided; as in the
case of grammars, the symbols and terminals are simply :obj:`strings <str>`.

.. autoclass:: Transition

   A convenience method is provided to obtain transtions from a suitable string
   representation of them.

   .. automethod:: from_string


From transitions one can obtain a representation of a (*nondeterministic*)
*finite state automata* using the following class.

.. autoclass:: Automaton

   Even for the automata there are a couple of convenience methods to obtain
   automata from a string representation of the transitions, or from a *regular
   grammar*.

   .. automethod:: from_string

   .. automethod:: from_grammar

    An utility method is provided to represent the *transition function* of the automata.

   .. automethod:: Î´

Automata can be displayed using :obj:`StateTransitionGraph.from_automaton <liblet.display.StateTransitionGraph.from_automaton>`.
