Welcome to LibLET
=================

LibLET is a library developed as a teaching aid for the `Linguaggi e traduttori
<https://let.di.unimi.it/>`_ class at the `Computer Science department
<https://www.di.unimi.it/>`_ of `Università degli Studi di Milano
<https://www.unimi.it/>`_ by `Massimo Santini <https://santini.di.unimi.it/>`_.

The main aim of the library is to provide a set of convenient data types
representing the usual objects of study of *formal languages* and *parsing*
such as, for example: *grammars*, *productions*, *trees*, *derivations*… so
that one can implement algorithms dealing with such objects in a
straightforward way. Moreover, for most of such types, a `rich display
<https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/integrating.html#rich-display>`_
is provided so that `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ can be fruitfully used to
explore and teach such algorithms.

Get started with :ref:`installation` and then get an overview with the
:ref:`examples`. The rest of the docs describe each component of LibLET in
detail, with a full reference in the :ref:`API` section.

.. note::

    Please observe that this library uses a **beaconing** mechanism based on the
    `Google Analytics Measurement Protocol
    <https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/>`__,
    see the :ref:`installation` on how to **disable** it.
