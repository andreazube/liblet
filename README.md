LibLET is a teaching aid for formal languages and compiler courses developed as part of the support material of [Linguaggi e Traduttori](https://let.di.unimi.it) class.

The library is under heavy development, it's available a [very preliminary documentation](https://liblet.rtfd.io).

Please observe that this library uses a *beaconing* mechanism based on the [Google Analytics Measurement Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/), please see the [installation instructions](https://liblet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) on how to **disable** it.
